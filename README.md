#config-ArchLinux

This repository will contain my personal Arch Linux configuration.

1. Configuration files located in ~/.config/ (they're in the ./config/ folder).

2. Configuration files located in ~/ (they're in the initial ./ folder).

3. ./pkglist.txt file (contains all the packages I use).

> Note: All configuration files and directories that begin with "." have had the period removed so they aren't shared as hidden files in my code editor :v

**Update:** 0.0.2
